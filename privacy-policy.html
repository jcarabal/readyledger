    <h1>Ready Ledger Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 14, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Ready Ledger ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how your personal information is collected, used, and disclosed by Ready Ledger.</p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>Ready Ledger does not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers.</strong> All data you enter into the app is stored locally on your device and, if you choose to enable iCloud sync, in your personal iCloud account managed by Apple.</p>

    <h3>Data Stored Locally</h3>
    <p>The app allows you to store the following types of information locally on your device:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Career Information:</strong> Job applications, employment records, skills, certifications, courses, achievements, and network contacts</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Information:</strong> Bills, payments, bank account balances, transactions, receipts, and expense records</li>
        <li><strong>Personal Content:</strong> Notes, journal entries, mood tracker entries, voice memos, photos, and documents you choose to attach</li>
        <li><strong>Schedule Information:</strong> Interviews, reminders, and calendar events</li>
        <li><strong>Profile Information:</strong> Your name, contact information, and profile photo (if provided)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>Your information is used solely for app functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To display your career, financial, and personal tracking data within the app</li>
        <li>To sync your data across your devices via iCloud (if enabled)</li>
        <li>To provide reminders and notifications you configure</li>
        <li>To generate reports and analytics within the app</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p><strong>Local Storage:</strong> All app data is stored on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework with built-in encryption.</p>
    <p><strong>iCloud Sync:</strong> If you enable iCloud sync, your data is transmitted to and stored in your personal iCloud account. This data is encrypted in transit and at rest by Apple. We do not have access to your iCloud data.</p>
    <p><strong>No Third-Party Access:</strong> We do not share, sell, or transmit your data to any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>Ready Ledger does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The app uses only Apple's native frameworks:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>iCloud for optional data sync</li>
        <li>StoreKit for in-app subscriptions</li>
        <li>Apple Calendar, Reminders, Notes, and Contacts (with your permission)</li>
        <li>VisionKit for receipt scanning</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request the following permissions, which you can grant or deny:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Camera:</strong> To scan receipts for expense tracking</li>
        <li><strong>Photo Library:</strong> To attach photos and documents</li>
        <li><strong>Microphone:</strong> To record voice memos</li>
        <li><strong>Calendar:</strong> To sync interview dates and job events</li>
        <li><strong>Reminders:</strong> To create task reminders</li>
        <li><strong>Contacts:</strong> To link network contacts with your address book</li>
        <li><strong>Face ID/Touch ID:</strong> For secure app access (optional)</li>
        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> To send reminders and alerts</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All permissions are optional, and the app will function with limited features if permissions are denied.</p>

    <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>
    <p>You have complete control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data can be deleted directly within the app</li>
        <li>Deleting the app removes all local data from your device</li>
        <li>iCloud data can be deleted through your iCloud settings</li>
        <li>We do not retain any copies of your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Ready Ledger is not intended for use by children under 13 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>In-App Purchases</h2>
    <p>Ready Ledger offers optional subscription purchases through Apple's App Store. All payment processing is handled by Apple, and we do not collect or store your payment information. Subscription information is managed through your Apple ID account.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. Your continued use of the app after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.</p>

    <h2>Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device and in your personal iCloud account, you have complete control over your information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access: View all your data within the app</li>
        <li>Correction: Edit any information directly in the app</li>

        <li>Export: Export your data in various formats (PDF, CSV)</li>
    </ul>
